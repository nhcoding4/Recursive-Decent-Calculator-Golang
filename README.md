Similar to my recursive decent parser in Ruby. Seems to do everything correctly (matches my system calculator with a bunch of inputs). Builds a tree from input in order to correctly bind tokens in order of precedence:

Highest >> Lowest
Base Numbers / Parenthesis
Multiplcation / Division
Addition / Subtraction.

Nothing else is supposed (it's very simple).
